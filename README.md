# Learning_Python
Programs created to display my progress at learning python 

Most of the programs I have written here are the exercises and questions from the following two books:       
Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist by Allen B Downey       
Learning Python by Mark Lutz    

I have also learnt a lot from the Series called Core Python available on the e-learning website www.pluralsight.com
